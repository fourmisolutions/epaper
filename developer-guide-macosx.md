Refer to the  [Ionic Getting Started guide](https://ionicframework.com/docs/v1/getting-started/) for more info.

1. Download and install JDK 8 from [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).

2. Download and install GIT from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

3. Download and install Node.js version 6.X LTS from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

4. Install the Cordova and Ionic command-line tools in Terminal
```
$ sudo npm install -g cordova@6.5.0
$ sudo npm install -g ionic@2.2.3
```

5. Install required tools - Android
  - Refer to the Apache Cordova for Android guide  [here](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/android/index.html):
    - Follow the guide to download and install Android Studio and the environment.
    - After installation, run the Android Studio once which will initiate the Setup Wizard to download and install the necessary SDK and packages.
      - Use "Standard" setup type.
      - Take note of the Android SDK installation folder, e.g. `/Users/XXX/Library/Android/sdk`.
    - Set the required OS environment variables:
      - JAVA_HOME: Local JDK installation.
      - ANDROID_HOME: e.g. `/Users/XXX/Library/Android/sdk`
      - PATH: append `$ANDROID_HOME/tools, $ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin, $ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools`.
    - Create an Android Virtual Device (AVD)
      - Refer to the guide [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds.html):
        - Using the Android Studio, create a dummy project first in order to to be able to access the `Android Studio > Tools > Android > AVD Manager`.

6. Install required tools - iOS
  - Refer to Apache Cordova for iOS guide [here](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/ios/index.html).
    - Install Xcode:
      - Select the Xcode version that is supported by the the Mac OS X version fo the development machine:
        - Refer to [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xcode#Version_comparison_table).
      - Download latest version of Xcode from [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12).
      - Search and download previous versions of Xcode from [here](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action). 
      - Choose Xcode 8.2.1 for Mac OS X El Capitan 10.11.6.
      - ``Note``: To submit apps to the Apple App Storeâ„  requires the latest versions of the Apple tools.
    - Enable command-line tools for Cordova to run:
      ```  
      $ xcode-select --install 
      $ npm install -g ios-sim
      $ npm install -g ios-deploy
      ```
    - Check available simulators:
      ```
      $ ios-sim showdevicetypes
      ```
    - Download and install new simulators for additional iOS SDK versions or platforms using the Xcode app (need to restart for newly installed simulators to be visible):
      - Xcode > Preferences... > Components
    - Install CocoaPods (refer to https://cocoapods.org/): 
      ```
      $ sudo gem install cocoapods

# Import Current Project into Local Repository

1. Open a Terminal.

2. Change current active directory to parent folder of the new project (replace [Parent Folder Name] with the intended folder name):
```
$ cd [Parent Folder Name]
```

3. Clone the GitHub project to local directory (replace [Branch Name] with the intended branch name, replace [Folder Name] with the intended folder name):
```
$ git clone --branch [Branch Name] https://github.com/fourmisolutions/epaper.git [Folder Name]
```

4. Change current activate directory to newly created project folder (replace [Folder Name] with the folder name defined in previous step):
```
$ cd [Folder Name]
```

5. Configure the project dependencies into new project folder (this will create the "node_modules" folder):
```
$ npm install
```

6. Explicitly add the required platforms to the project folder:
```
$ ionic platform add android@6.1.0
```
*Trouble-shooting: Possible Error #4*

```
$ ionic platform add ios@4.3.1
```
*Trouble-shooting: Possible Error #5*

7. Copy the required resources into "platforms" folder:
```
$ ionic resources
```

8. Configure the platform and plugins into new project folder (this will create the "platform" and "plugins" folders):
```
$ ionic state reset
```
*Trouble-shooting: Possible Error #2*

9. Build the project for android:
```
$ ionic build android
```
*Trouble-shooting: Possible Error #3*

10. Launch and view the application on an android emulator or connected android phone:
```
$ ionic run android
```

11. Build the project for iOS:
```
$ ionic build ios
```

12. Launch and view the application on an iOS emulator:
```
$ ionic run ios
```

13. Launch and view the application on a browser:
```
$ ionic serve
```
